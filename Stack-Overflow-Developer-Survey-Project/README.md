## Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2023 Analysis
This project is based on the [Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2023](https://edgeservices.bing.com/edgesvc/%5E1%5E), which is a comprehensive survey of developers around the world. The project aims to provide insights and analysis on the survey data using Python code and visualizations2.

## Data Source
The survey data can be downloaded from the [Stack Overflow website](https://edgeservices.bing.com/edgesvc/%5E2%5E). The data consists of two CSV files: survey_results_public.csv and survey_results_schema.csv. The first file contains the responses from 89,184 developers, and the second file contains the questions and descriptions for each column in the first file.

## Libraries Used
The project uses the following Python libraries:
- pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
- matplotlib: for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations
- seaborn: for making statistical graphics

## Notebook Structure
The project is organized into a Jupyter notebook that contains the following sections:
- **Introduction**: gives an overview of the project objective, data source, and libraries used
- **Data Import**: imports the survey data and the schema data into pandas DataFrames
- **Visualizations**: creates various plots that show the distribution and relationship of different variables in the survey data, such as age, education, salary, language, AI, etc4.
- **Inference**: summarizes the main findings and insights from the visualizations
- **Limitations**: discusses some of the limitations of the analysis due to the nature of the survey data
- **Recommendations**: provides some recommendations for developers who want to improve their skills and career prospects based on the analysis
- **Conclusion**: concludes the project and highlights some of the key takeaways
